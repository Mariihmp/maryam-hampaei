    title: "LLM Safety Evaluation Framework",
    description:
      "A comprehensive framework for evaluating safety properties of large language models including toxicity, bias, and adversarial robustness.",
    longDescription: `Built a modular evaluation pipeline that tests LLMs across multiple safety dimensions. The framework supports custom red-teaming prompts, automated scoring with GPT-4 as judge, and generates detailed safety reports with actionable recommendations.

Key features include:
- Automated red-teaming with 500+ adversarial prompts
- Multi-dimensional safety scoring (toxicity, bias, hallucination, privacy)
- Integration with HuggingFace model hub for easy model loading
- CI/CD pipeline for continuous safety monitoring
- Interactive dashboard for exploring evaluation results`,
